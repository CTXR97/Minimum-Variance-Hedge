# Minimum-Variance-Hedge

Given the presence of basis risk, the minimum-variance hedge is a means to hedge if the assets are different, as in a cross-hedge. When a trader enters a cross-hedge, they are using different assets to hedge.

Letâ€™s first construct a cash flow for a hedge.

We can use beta, the correlation coefficient, instead of the equation above if the obligation has is for a fixed notional hedge amount. Effectively,

Once we have found the optimal hedge ratio, we can find the number of futures contracts to purchase.

In Python Code (To-do):
1. Find the variance of Spot
2. Find the variance of Fut
3. Find the Correlation
4. Formulate the hedge ratio
5. Based on the hedge ratio, define a function to allow user to input notional amount and price of futures to get hedge units
